//How to interface LVGL with ESP32:
1. Firstly I downloaded the Adruino IDE from the official Adruino website adruino.cc

2.I Opened the Arduino IDE, then I went to "File" -> "Preferences."
In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, I added the following URL:https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json and then 
Clicked "OK" to close the Preferences window.

3. Then to Install ESP32 Boards so we can control the boards with the adruino  IDE. I went to "Tools" -> "Board" -> "Boards Manager."
and Searched for "esp32" and then installed the "ESP32 by Espressif Systems" package.

4.Install LVGL from Library Manager:
In the Arduino IDE, I went to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries."
I Searched for "lvgl" and installed the "lvgl" library by LVGL Community.

5.I Created a New Sketch:

By Opening the Arduino IDE,
Going to "File" -> "New" to create a new sketch.

6.Including The LVGL Library:

At the top of my Arduino sketch, I included the LVGL library:

#include <lvgl.h>

Now I can Write my LVGL-based GUI code in the Arduino sketch. 

7. Configure ESP32 Board:

I haven't done this yet because I don't have a board yet
